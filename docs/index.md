# Project Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for **Project** – an internal IT application used to manage client accounts, trades, and operational workflows.

This documentation is split into two main tracks:

- **Functional documentation** – what the system does from a business and user perspective.
- **Technical documentation** – how the system is designed, built, deployed, and operated.

## Audience

- **Business users & product owners** – start with [Functional specification](functional/index.md) and [Getting started](getting-started/index.md).
- **Developers & architects** – see [Technical documentation](technical/architecture.md).
- **Support & operations** – see [Runbook](operations/runbook.md).

## High-level capabilities

- Centralized management of client accounts
- Trade capture and lifecycle events
- Configurable approval workflows
- Role-based access for operations, compliance, and support

For a conceptual overview, see [System architecture](technical/architecture.md).
